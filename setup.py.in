      '''Lyricsgrabber is a very simple python script which searches lyrics 
      for MP3s and embeds them in their tags. Relies on leoslyrics.com, 
      chartlyrics.com, and eyeD3 for tagging. You pass Lyricsgrabber a 
      directory or it automatically starts in the current working directory. 
      It then collects all MP3 files in that directory, looks up their lyrics 
      according to artist and trackname tags and, if it finds some text, 
      stores them in the appropriate tag. If successful, it should be possible
       to view the song lyrics on your iPod. You could make Lyricsgrabber 
       search for MP3 files recursively below the start directory. 
       Lyricsgrabber features logging, so you could see what texts have been 
       written to what files.
