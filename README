General Information
===================
Lyricsgrabber is a very simple python script which searches lyrics  for
MP3s  and  embeds  them in their tags. Relies on leoslyrics.com, chart-
lyrics.com, and eyeD3 for tagging. You pass Lyricsgrabber  a  directory
or  it  automatically starts in the current working directory.  It then
collects all MP3 files in that directory, looks up their lyrics accord-
ing  to  artist  and  trackname tags and, if it finds some text, stores
them in the appropriate tag.  If successful, it should be  possible  to
view the song lyrics on your iPod.  You could make Lyricsgrabber search
for MP3 files recursively below  the  start  directory.   Lyricsgrabber
features logging, so you could see what texts have been written to what
files.
